# 🚀 Data Structures in Java

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Java. Each data structure is implemented with efficiency in mind and includes explanations and example use cases.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Well-structured and optimized Java implementations.
- 📚 Covers essential data structures such as:
  - 📌 Arrays
  - 🔗 Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
  - 🥞 Stacks
  - 🏭 Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
  - 🔢 Hash Tables
  - 🌳 Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, Heap, Trie)
  - 🔗 Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A\*)
- 📌 Each data structure includes:
  - 🛠 Implementation
  - 📝 Explanation
  - 🔍 Example Usage
  - ⏳ Complexity Analysis

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HaithamAbuDraz/Data-Structures-Java.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the examples to explore different data structures.

## 📌 Usage

Each data structure has its own package and class with detailed comments. You can navigate through the folders to find the required implementation.

Example usage for a Stack:

```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Outputs: 20
```
